		  "It is usually the mother of the household who has to distribute the earnings for each necessity the family members have. She is the one to pay for the total cost of bills and other living expenses. Not having enough basic salary is a struggle for families living in the Philippines. The average salary is not that huge to provide for the entire family. Imagine having three kids going to school, the higher the grade level the higher cost it would take for them to continue attending the school. How about the leisure activities the kids have to experience? Even going to a mid-range restaurant is impossible because it is not necessary as compared to the that would be demand for food, shelter, and clothes. Living in the Philippines is quite expensive nowadays. The Philippines is one of the third-world countries in Southeast Asia which has an estimated annual inflation rate of 6.4 as of July 2022. And it has been predicted that it might increase as the months pass by. The abrupt change in the inflation rate is due to the impact of Covid-19—the global pandemic as well as the new programs and regulations of the new administration in the Philippines. Basic utilities’ prices have risen as well as public transportation costs increase due to the fuel price hike. Prepaid mobile tariff is even a concern, luckily there are network provider who created unlimited data plan consumable for the children’s online classes. Not to mention that the Philippines is the second highest rent prices in the world next to the country Singapore. Data aggregator iprice group recorded Filipino workers have an average monthly net salary of 45, 000 pesos ($4791.97). While the minimum daily average salary is 537 pesos ($9.42). The monthly deduction will be mandatory for government taxes and this includes the Social Security System (SSS), Philhealth, and Pag-ibig. The monthly budget would be too tight for them to cover the family’s monthly costs. Health insurance is very important yet Filipinos would not be able to afford insurance premiums or health insurance for their family members. Compare cost calculates the living index and as of 2022, the cost of living index in the Philippines is at 36.66. According to NUMBEO, a family of four estimated monthly costs 102, 006 pesos ($1,790.15) whereas they do not have rental costs. It is 29,198 pesos ($512.39) for a single person. But if they rent an average monthly rent of one bedroom apartment, is around 6, 000 pesos ($105.29) (note that this is Manila-based which is one of the most expensive cities where luxury real estate is in demand). Cheaper cities’ rent is less. This is too much for minimum wage earners so citizens tend to be thrifty as much as possible just to save money and reduce living expenses. Food costs 600 pesos ($10.56) daily as it is the biggest expense people in the Philippines allot their earnings on. But for example, if you are eating solo while you are at work, the cheapest you can get for a budget meal would range from 50 to 55 pesos ($.88 to $.97) excluding any flavored drink. So in order to cut food costs, people will most likely shop from local markets than at a high-end supermarket for them to have good home-cooked food as it is cheaper than eating in mid-range restaurants. They also buy from local brands instead of imported brands because it’s quite expensive and out of their budget. Meanwhile, transportation costs differ in the distance between the workplace and school. The minimum public transport fare nowadays in the Philippines is 11 to 15 pesos ($.19-$.26). Discounts are applied to transportation costs if you are a student, senior citizen, or a person with a disability (PWD). There will be a 20 percent deduction on that minority section in transportation fares to help them with their daily expenses. Last 2021, Manila ranked 3rd as the most expensive city to live in Southeast Asia’s neighboring countries. This is evidently seen as the cost of living in the Philippines in this area is higher than the average salary of an individual. Moreover, Cebu is also one of the most expensive cities to live in as it is ranked 60th all over other cities in Asia. These two large cities were known to be the metropolis city center in the Philippines. Cebu is known for its tourism and Manila as the capital of the Philippines makes employment higher than any other city. Compared to rural areas, the cost of living in these cities is obviously higher. For example one order of a dish in a local food store costs 45 pesos ($.79), in Manila it’s 50 to 55 pesos ($.88 to $.97). A food chain in a city center is a place where people can get a meal that is already considered a privilege. International release plays an important role in the country’s economic growth. It is questionable how we have many landfills for rice and other crops but still imports from other countries. Although we also make exports from western countries, the import rate is higher than the export rate so it still contributes to the cost of living in the Philippines as prices may vary—price for food, transportation, electricity, and other utilities. But someplace in the Philippines is really great place to live. Especially in the rural areas where the environment is peaceful far from the pollution the city produces because of the emission of gas in the jammed transportation system. One of the places you would want to travel with or have a staycation in Tagaytay City, which is a part of the province of Cavite in the Philippines. The place is known as a landlocked city in Cavite’s coastal province island of Luzon. The city has a total land area of 65.00 square kilometers or 25.10 square miles, accounting for 4.26% of the total area of Cavite. Most beautiful houses in the Philippines can be seen in this location. According to the 2020 Census, its population was 85,330 people. This accounted for 1.96% of the total population of Cavite province, or 0.53% of the CALABARZON region’s total population. Based on these data, the population density is calculated to be 1,313 people per square kilometer or 3,400 people per square mile. Thanks to its high altitude the city is well known for its cold weather, especially during the months when Christmas is near. In conclusion, living in the Philippines is now too costly, especially for normal Filipino wage earners. It is evident that the cost of living in the Philippines does not satisfy its people. The government should work more on the economic growth of the country where the appropriate balancing of supply and demand of the products were weighed accordingly to avoid sudden changes in the market price. This is to not add to the burden that workers from the Philippines have been experiencing. Everyone has the right to life, and so it is the state’s responsibility to ensure that its fellow citizens can afford at least three proper meals a day. Although needs should be prioritized over wants, sometimes leisure is something the body needs to detoxify. Therefore it is also important to prioritize resting time."

		"content": [
		  "Lately, we have started to notice that it is also getting to be more expensive to live in the Philippines. Prices of basic goods and services are going up. Food prices, power rates, medical care… you name it and the cost is up. Those of us who are lucky enough to have something to eat three times a day should wonder how others manage. When Social Weather Stations asked them, half of all the Filipino respondents told SWS they felt poor. Many told SWS they suffer involuntary hunger some days of the month due to lack of money to buy food. The bare fact we have this problem is negligence and corruption from over half a century of electing corrupt politicians who have no sense of public interest. As if stealing from the National Treasury is not enough, they also neglected our problems in agriculture and energy until these problems now look unsolvable. Coconuts Manila, a news website, reports that “Filipinos have begun comparing the prices of goods in supermarkets abroad versus those at home. One post on Reddit, in particular, said that one can purchase more with P650 (US$13) in Singapore than in Manila and showed receipts – literally. With foreign corporations headquartered in Hong Kong leaving as China tightens the political screws, there are some folks here who are dreaming of offering Manila an alternative site for regional headquarters. Perish the thought. It is not worthwhile to suffer Third World governance with our increasingly First World living expenses. As for the cost of living, the Esquire article notes Numbeo, a database platform that compiles the cost of living in different places around the world, showed Manila came in third highest at P50,800, just slightly below Bangkok at P51,500. The study takes into account the usual necessities, including rent, food, transportation, utilities, etc. Not including rent, the total cost of living is still about P28,800 per month in Manila."

		"title": "Cost of Living in the Philippines and its computation",
		"content": [
		  "As recently as March 2022, the price of food in the Philippines increased by 2.6%. This may be heavily attributed to the increase in gas prices due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, as Russia is one of the primary drivers of the fuel industry. Such is an important factor in the increase in food prices as there is an indispensable need to transport food products from the sources, such as the rural farms and fisheries. Such added cost is therefore added to the price of the food in order to compensate for the extra expense brought about by the fuel price increase. This is also one of the reasons why the cost of living in the rural areas, as reflected by the minimum wages of rural areas, is comparatively lower as opposed to urbanized and metropolitan regions. It is in the rural regions where the majority of our raw food products come from, such as vegetables, fruits, crops, livestock, and fish. Such is then transported to the urbanized areas where agriculture is not as thriving as its landscape is dominated by residential, commercial, and industrial infrastructures. Another factor in the increase of food prices is the archipelagic design of the country, which increases the transport time and the consequent expenses of the same. The Philippines, being one of the most affected countries when it comes to typhoons, does not help as well with regard to the food prices in the Philippines. The Philippines experiences an average of 20 typhoons and storms of varying intensities. Such typhoons adversely affect the production of food products in the rural areas when farmers are unable to harvest and sell the products which they have been growing for months on end. The seasonality of certain crops also adds an extra level of difficulty to the unfortunate situation. s healthcare and insurance is the same across all regions. That is why most of the population, especially those living below the poverty line, are unable to afford access to healthcare and insurance. Such is more important today, as we are still being ravaged by the pandemic. In case one is hospitalized, access to healthcare and insurance would alleviate the cost of hospital expenses incurred. Arguably, these two should be an indispensable expense of the Filipinos. In reality, however, everyone is not similarly situated. education is sadly not afforded the same level of necessity. Although the majority of Filipinos acknowledge that education is important, access to affordable and quality education. Thanks to our legislators, however, through Republic Act 10931 or the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act enacted last 2017, has made tertiary education free in state universities and colleges with respect to tuition. However, tuition fees are not the only expenses that parents and breadwinners need to consider in the funding of one’s education. People still need to shell out money for books, learning materials, and other indispensable costs of education. The need for gadgets for the commencement of online or virtual classes also added an additional burden for parents. As such, many of our youth often temporarily or worse, permanently leave their studies to work and add to the income of the household. A macro-level discussion on how gas and transportation affect the cost of living of people was explained in a previous item. From a micro-level perspective, high gas and transportation cost heavily burden the people. Commuting in the Philippines is a chore, considering that our public transportation is not enough to accommodate the behemoth number of people who commute from their homes to their place of work. Those who can afford to buy a private vehicle also do not escape the heavy cost of fuel needed to drive said vehicles. Not to mention the effect of having more cars on the street which primarily contributes to the traffic problem plaguing the nation. Additionally, utility expenses such as electricity and water also add to one’s cost of living in the Philippines. Utility expense is not constant and is contingent upon the consumer’s usage. In the Philippines, being a tropical country, it gets really hot and humid. So it is expected that during the summer season, which runs for months, the expenses for electricity and water are expected to increase. May it be buying and maintaining a house, or renting a room or apartment, housing takes up the biggest bulk in one’s cost of living in the Philippines. In Manila alone, the average annual salary of a worker is only enough to afford 1.5 square meters, which places the city as the second most expensive city in Asia for residential property buyers. Now that we have discussed the top factors which drive up the cost of living in a particular area, let us now discuss how we compute the same. Basically, we just need to add all the expenses per a particular time, whether it be a month or a year. According to Inquirer.net, the city of Manila ranks third in Southeast Asia’s most expensive cities in a research conducted by data aggregator iPrice Group, with a cost of living of P50,800 for a single person. The city is only 1% behind Bangkok, with a cost of living of P51,500 per person. Of course, the cost of living cited in the study is just the ideal amount in order to live a relatively comfortable life. However, a lot, if not a majority, of Filipinos struggle even just to put food on their table. As such, we must compare the cost of living in the Philippines with other areas of the country to be able to get an honest assessment"

		"title": "The Cost of Living",
		"content": [
		  "We have all heard the expression “making ends meet.” It’s a popular expression among those working and struggling to pay for their living expenses with what they earn at work. The idiom is more commonly broken down to mean paying for things you need to live when you aren’t making enough money or have little money. This has become more poignant over the past two years, as many Filipinos are barely making enough to get through each day. As we continue to cautiously emerge from the pandemic and carve out a new way forward, making ends meet is becoming even more challenging than before. Before COVID-19 hit, it was already challenging to pay living expenses when the cost of essential goods and services kept increasing while employee salaries remained the same. The same is true today, but has been exacerbated more because of the challenges of the past two years. These days, companies are barely surviving and can barely meet paying salaries and expenses, let alone raising wages. But while employees can clearly understand that, it also doesn’t help them make it through their day-to-day. One job is no longer enough for many Filipinos to sustain a family. Everyone is stretching themselves thin, trying to find more work to pay for what they need. Many said the pandemic was a great equalizer, and in some ways, it was. Everyone was at risk during the health crisis, and no amount of money or privilege could keep the virus at bay. However, while we were all in the same storm during COVID-19, it was vital to point out that we weren’t all in the same boat. While everyone worried about weathering the storm, some people could do so in the comfort of a proverbial yacht, while many more were barely keeping their dinghy afloat. And now, as we enter a new chapter in this journey, it’s become more challenging than ever. We are trying to remain focused on health and safety protocols, but at the same time, this is often taking a backseat to finding ways to just get by. Companies are starting to require more employees to be back in the office full-time, which means more expenses, including transportation, food, etc, which costs many may have taken for granted saving while working from home. And while it is definitely good that business can operate fully now, it’s crucial to understand how we can be more efficient in all the financial challenges we’re facing. With the ongoing conflict in Russia and Ukraine, we’ve seen a consistent surge in fuel prices. While on the surface, this may seem like just one problem, the reality is that it impacts everything we do. With gas prices rising, that means transportation costs are rising. This will impact daily expenses and profoundly impact daily household budgets. Coming out of a two-year pandemic where work was already difficult, this means that Filipino families will struggle even more. We need to find ways to help mitigate these rising costs or the bulk of our population will drown. A survey on family income and expenditure conducted by the Philippine Statistics Authority showed that roughly 40.2 percent of Filipinos belong to the middle class. In comparison, 58.4 percent were low income, and a very tiny margin of 1.4 percent made up the high income. I’m sure this has changed even more in the past two years, and most Filipinos now belong to the class struggling to make ends meet. We need to find ways to ride this new wave that threatens our people once again. With no known end in sight for the conflict, there has to be other ways to cope with the burden of high fuel prices. One of the most obvious is to keep promoting work from home setups for companies that can operate this way. The pandemic has shown that remote working works. While it’s understandable that employees and teams also need face-to-face interaction and collaboration, forcing the workforce back 100 percent every day without raising salaries to compensate for travel expenses is just going to tax already struggling budgets. Either a hybrid setup or a shorter workweek can do wonders with helping people save. If you add up the travel expenses for even just one day, it can already amount to a lot. For a middle-class employee who drives to work, P500 for gas, P200 for toll, and P100 for parking. That’s roughly P800 a week in savings, which can significantly impact their ability to pay for the cost of living. Currently, the government is exploring a condensed work week for government offices. This was also done during the energy crunch in 2008 and the Gulf War in the ‘90s. They are also urging the private sector to consider this scheme as well. This means working smarter, not harder. Something that companies should already focus on. A team’s productivity should not be measured by the number of hours they spend at their desks, but rather by the quality of work and output they produce. Perhaps if we focus on re-training ourselves to be more efficient and not concentrate on hitting hour quotas, we can learn to be more efficient in all aspects of life – not just at the office. Another step is to explore fuel alternatives. While this is more of a long-term solution that can’t do as much to stop the current bleeding, it’s still worth looking into for the long haul. The government can look into some alternatives to mitigate our dependence on fossil fuels: natural gas, hydropower, wind, solar, and geothermal. The world has been trying to wean itself off fossil fuels, and this crisis makes this need even more urgent. We’re all moving forward and while keeping healthy and safe remains a priority, we also need to find ways to build a more sustainable future. One in which all Filipinos can make ends meet."

		"content": [
		  "Housing costs in the Philippines vary significantly between major cities and smaller towns or rural areas. As stated above, living in urban centers like Manila, Cebu, and Davao is more expensive than in the provinces. In Manila, the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment in the city center is around PHP18,137, while a three-bedroom apartment in the city center costs an average of PHP39,240.  The prices are lower Outside the city center, with a one-bedroom apartment costing around PHP9,916 and a three-bedroom apartment costing PHP20,835. Cebu City has slightly lower housing costs than Manila. The monthly rent for a studio apartment in Cebu is approximately PHP19,800. In Davao, the largest city in Mindanao, housing is more affordable. A one-bedroom apartment in the city center has an average monthly rent of around PHP9,000, while a three-bedroom apartment costs about PHP15,000. In contrast, housing costs in smaller towns and rural areas are significantly lower. For example, in the province of Aklan, the price for an apartment is around 5,000 PHP ($95) per month. In rural areas, rent can be as low as 2,500 PHP per month for a simple home. When buying property, prices also differ significantly between urban and rural locations. In Metro Manila, the average cost per square meter for an apartment is 13,685 PHP.  However, prices can be as low as 1,000 PHP per square meter in less urbanized areas. Overall, housing costs in the Philippines are highest in major cities like Manila and Cebu. At the same time, smaller towns and rural areas offer more affordable options for renting and buying property. "

		  "Food and grocery expenses are a significant part of the cost of living in the Philippines. The average monthly price of groceries for a single person is around PHP6,500. However, this can vary depending on factors such as location, lifestyle, and where you choose to shop. A meal at an inexpensive restaurant typically costs around PHP200, while a three-course meal for two at a mid-range restaurant averages PHP1,200. Fast food options, such as a McMeal at McDonald’s, cost approximately PHP200. Local food stalls and street vendors offer even more affordable options, with meals often costing less than PHP100. Filipinos choose between local markets (known as “palengkes”) and supermarkets for grocery shopping. These markets are the go-to spots for fresh, affordable produce, meat, and seafood. Prices at these markets are generally lower than in supermarkets. For example, 1 kilogram of pork costs PHP280-PHP400 at wet markets, while 1 kilogram of chicken is priced at PHP150-PHP200. On the other hand, supermarkets offer a more comprehensive selection of products, including imported goods, and are often more convenient. However, prices tend to be higher compared to wet markets. A side-by-side comparison of grocery prices between the Philippines and Canada found that while some items were more expensive in the Philippines, others were surprisingly on par with Canadian prices. To save money on food expenses, many expats and locals choose to shop at wet markets for fresh ingredients and only visit supermarkets for specific items that cannot be found elsewhere. Cooking meals at home using local ingredients is also cost-effective, as dining out frequently can quickly add up."

		  "Getting around in the Philippines can be an adventure, and the good news is that there are plenty of options to suit every budget. Public transportation is the way to go if you’re looking to save some cash. As stated above, jeepneys rides are as little as PHP12 per ride. Tricycles, which are motorcycles with a sidecar, are another affordable option for short trips, with fares starting at around PHP10. If you’re in Manila, hop on the MRT (Metro Rail Transit) or LRT (Light Rail Transit) for a quick and efficient way to get around. Fares range from PHP15-PHP30 depending on the distance. If you prefer the convenience of having your wheels, be prepared to shell out some serious cash. Buying a car in the Philippines can be expensive, with a basic sedan like a Toyota Vios starting at around PHP700,000, and that’s just the beginning – you’ll also need to factor in the cost of maintenance, insurance, and fuel, which can add up quickly. Consider getting a motorcycle or scooter for a more affordable option. Prices start at around PHP50,000 for a basic model, and they’re a lot cheaper to maintain and insure than a car. Just be sure to invest in a good helmet and protective gear, as traffic in the Philippines can be chaotic. If you’re looking to save money and get some exercise at the same time, why not try biking or walking? Many cities in the Philippines are becoming more bike-friendly, with dedicated bike lanes and rental options everywhere. Walking is also a great way to explore your neighborhood and get to know the locals. Biking and walking may not be practical for longer distances or during the hot and humid summer months. But short trips around town are a great way to save money and stay in shape. "

		"title": "Cost of Living in the Philippines: Healthcare",
		"content": [
		  "Understanding the difference between private health insurance and public healthcare is crucial. While both options have pros and cons, the costs can vary quite a bit. People who want more comprehensive coverage and can customize their plans prefer private insurance. But be prepared to shell out some serious cash. Depending on the type of coverage you choose, you could look at premiums anywhere from PHP1500 to PHP10,000 per month. On the other hand, public healthcare through PhilHealth is a much more affordable option. If you’re employed, your contributions will be automatically deducted from your paycheck, and your employer will cover half of the cost. This works out to around 4% of most people’s monthly salary. So, if you’re making PHP10,000 per month, you’ll pay around PHP450 for your PhilHealth coverage. But here’s the thing – even with PhilHealth, you might still have to pay some out-of-pocket expenses. A recent study found that Filipinos shoulder anywhere from 34% to 44.7% of their medical costs, even with PhilHealth coverage. That means if you have a hospital stay costing PHP100,000, you could be on the hook for up to PHP44,700 out of your pocket. Some common out-of-pocket expenses that Filipinos face include doctor’s fees, laboratory tests, and medication. These costs can add up quickly, especially if you have a severe illness or injury. A study by the World Health Organization found that the average Filipino spends about PHP9,839 per year on healthcare expenses. Healthcare costs in the Philippines are a mixed bag. While public healthcare through PhilHealth is more affordable, you may need more than just what you need. Although private insurance (including HMOs) can offer more comprehensive coverage, it comes at a steeper price. The key is to research, understand your options, and find the right balance for your budget and your health needs."

		"title": "The truth about why living in the Philippines costs more than it should",
		"content": [
		  "Inflation is most visible in our everyday food consumption. This is illustrated by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures drastic changes in the costs of goods over time. Instead of measuring each item in the market, the CPI bundles products regularly bought together by the average consumer. Think of it as a basket of everything you need to survive daily. A year ago, your P1,000 could buy 3 kilos of pork and 2 cartons of milk. Now, P1,000 can only go as far as 2 kilos of pork and a single carton of milk. This signifies our decreasing purchasing power. When the COVID-19 pandemic sent the world to a standstill, the economy didn’t function the way it was programmed. The government borrowed money and in turn, households received subsidies—a way to keep the money in rotation or, simply, the economy alive. But to keep market prices stable, the number of goods available must always match what people want to buy. However, due to road closures and high fuel prices, businesses were unable to get the supplies they needed to produce the same amount of goods. Demand increased while the supply remained low, tipping the scale. Soon enough, news of soaring inflation rates flooded the mainstream media. In December 2022, inflation peaked at 8.1%, the worst spike in over a decade. Supply-driven, as experts would say. Perhaps this was already expected in the midst of our recovering economy, but high costs trickling down to the average Filipino now meant putting in long hours of hard work without much return. Filipinos, often lauded as madiskarte, have always been the ones to adjust. Punongbayan lists the ways we’ve learned to survive: “From buying tingi-tingi, taking multiple jobs, getting emergency payday loans, cutting back on luxuries, asking for remittances from relatives, and maximizing ayuda from the government.” These have become strategic coping mechanisms. “But these can only do so much.” Punongbayan shares that the Bangko ng Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) took measures by raising policy rates—a big move from an economic standpoint. Despite this, food remains outside their scope. “BSP implored other government agencies, particularly the Department of Agriculture, to implement ‘non-monetary’ policies to temper food inflation. Unfortunately, over the past year, the government largely failed to control prices.”. Lowering inflation relies largely on government intervention. Punongbayan emphasizes the need to address long-term agricultural issues such as low productivity. There must be investment and financial support in place to ensure each sector is padded amid economic instability—something that should come easy, now that the president is our agriculture secretary.

		"content": [
		  "Prices in the Philippines are soaring – and faster than anywhere elsewhere in Southeast Asia, apart from war-torn Myanmar and socialist Laos. In February, inflation reached 8.6 percent – down a hair from the previous month – far outpacing Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam. While most households are tightening their belts, the situation for lower-income families is particularly difficult. Whereas wealthier Philippine households spend less than two-fifths of their income on food, those in the bottom 30 percent of the income distribution spend nearly 60 percent of their earnings on sustenance, according to government statistics. Under a special Consumer Price Index (CPI) used to measure cost-of-living pressures for lower-income households, inflation in February hit the equivalent of 9.7 percent – unchanged from the previous month. The Philippines is especially vulnerable to inflation due to a combination of factors, including high consumption taxes and elevated production and distribution costs following the privatisation of public utilities, said Rosario Guzman, head of research at the IBON Foundation, an economic think tank. Then-President Rodrigo Duterte’s introduction of an excise tax on all petroleum products in 2018, on top of the existing value-added tax (VAT) of 12 percent, had an especially severe impact on the poor, Guzman said. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr has dismissed calls to suspend the VAT or excise tax on fuel, blaming high pump prices on the war in Ukraine and other external forces. Jonathan Ravelas, the former chief market strategist of BDO bank and now managing director of eManagement for Business and Marketing Services, said the cost-of-living crisis had exposed the Philippines’ overreliance on imported food. While the Philippine central bank has raised its benchmark rate to 6.25 percent, Ravelas said it needs to go further to bring down inflation. "

		  "Budgeting in the Philippines is no small feat. Aside from food and housing, Filipinos also require other things such as clothes, transportation, healthcare, and even emergency money in order to survive and perform their daily tasks at work. Numbeo reports that, on average, it would take at least Php 28,000 per month for a single Filipino person to survive in the Philippines. More if said Filipino is living in Metro Manila. Though this number also includes unnecessary expenses such as regular meals outside and certain vices, it should still be important to spend your money wisely. Moreover, the Numbeo report also takes into account the additional expenses incurred by a family of four. Such a family would need Php 96,000 per month to cover all expenses. That includes education and clothing expenses for the children. Investing in properties is a good way to generate income for you and your family. You’d generally like to search for properties in their pre-selling stages in order to maximize your gains, however."

		"content": [
		  "Interest rates started rising in May due to policy tightening by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), Domini S. Velasquez, chief economist at China Banking Corp., said in an e-mail. The BSP raised borrowing costs by 350 basis points (bps) last year, bringing the key rate to a 14-year high of 5.5% as it tried to tame inflation. “We could see the effects of higher borrowing costs on exchange rates and demand for securities,” she said. “As interest rates in the US continue to rise, investors are moving their money to US securities to take advantage of higher yields. The increased demand is then causing the dollar to strengthen further against other currencies.”. Interest rates on loans, including those for housing and credit cards, are expected to continue going up given the lag in the effects of the central bank’s policy tightening. Philippine economic output grew by 7.2% in the fourth quarter, bringing 2022 growth to 7.6% — higher than expected and better than the government’s 6.5-7.5% goal. The government expects growth at 6-7% this year amid a looming global economic slowdown. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said the economy would probably grow by 5% this year, mainly due to the BSP’s monetary tightening. This is higher than its 4.3% estimate for ASEAN-5 and 2.9% for the world. The effects of monetary tightening are not directly felt because it merely sets into motion a series of events that would likely lead to slower growth, he said. Only then will inflation slow.If the BSP hiked key rates by 100 bps today, projects and investments that are already in play would likely continue, Mr. Mapa said. But in the next six to 18 months, potential investments that are no longer going to happen — deterred by higher borrowing costs — would mean fewer people will be hired. The unemployment rate further eased to 4.2% in November — the lowest in 17 years and equivalent to 2.177 million unemployed Filipinos. But job quality worsened, with the underemployment rate rising by 0.2 point to 14.4% from a month earlier. Underemployed Filipinos rose by 488,000 to 7.161 million from October. The same could be said about credit cards, Mr. Mapa said. “Rates for credit cards were capped throughout the pandemic and had not been affected by recent rate hikes, which might explain why spending has been relatively resilient despite higher inflation and rising borrowing costs for all other types of loans,” he said. He added that as the central bank adjusts the ceiling on credit card charges, there could be a similar slowdown in purchases The BSP raised the monthly interest rate ceiling for credit cards to 3% effective this month to reflect its recent policy tightening, after keeping it at 2% for the past two years. Aside from indirectly affecting consumer demand, policy tightening is crucial to manage inflation expectations, Ms. Velasquez said. “Inflation expectations have the potential to be self-fulfilling,” she said. “Seeing the BSP’s actions to bring down inflation, the public may be convinced that prices will eventually go down. Thus, people will only factor in modest price increases in their wage and price-setting decisions.” Consumers are unlikely to borrow more due to rising interest rates. Bank lending growth slowed to 13.4% in December from a month earlier. Consumer and business sentiment declined in the fourth quarter due to higher prices and rising interest rates. The consumer confidence index worsened to -14.6% from -12.9% a quarter earlier, while the business confidence index fell to 23.9% from 26.1%. The central bank expects inflation to average at 4.5% this year, higher than its 2-4% goal, before easing to 2.8% in 2024. Central bank Governor Felipe M. Medalla has said they would manage inflation expectations, signaling more rate increases in the first quarter. The Monetary Board will hold its first policy review on Feb. 16."

		  "As with anywhere, the cost of living in the Philippines will depend greatly on the lifestyle you choose to lead—but you can certainly live well here on a low budget. If you live like a local, shop where they shop, eat where they eat, you can get by on a monthly budget of just over $760, even near some of the big cities and famous beaches. Of course the bigger the budget, the more lavish the lifestyle. A couple can live like royalty on $2,280 a month anywhere in the Philippines. For that money, you can enjoy life’s finer things…massages… maids…country club membership…travel… Since rent will be your biggest expense, it’s important to take time to find the right property. The best—and cheapest—way to find a place isn’t through a real estate agent, but by word of mouth. If you like city living then you could consider Cebu City, one of the largest cities in the Philippines and home to all the shops, restaurants, and bars you could want. As an added bonus, the beach is only a 30-minute drive away. Rents in the city are higher, but you can get a one-bedroom, furnished apartment with city and ocean views for under $760. Move out of the city a little and costs go down considerably. There are three-bedroom townhouses in Banilad—a trendy neighborhood about four miles from the heart of Cebu—that rent for $535 a month. In Liloan, a district about 10 miles from the city, you can rent a house for as little as $215 a month. With a more generous budget, you can get serious bang for your buck, a three-bedroom beach house, close to amenities, with a pool and garage, can be had for less than $1,295 a month. No matter where you choose to live in the Philippines, you won’t have to purchase your own vehicle—unless of course you want to. The Philippines are known for their kooky modes of public transport and they’re so cheap that many people forgo that big purchase. A local tuk-tuk or scooter taxi will cost pennies per ride and the longer trips on a jeepney won’t be much more. If you choose to splash out, you can pick up a brand new scooter from as little as $1,065, or a secondhand one for around $380. When it comes to food, costs will depend on whether you splurge on imported brands from back home or switch to local brands, which are cheaper. The most cost-efficient way to shop is at local daily markets which are brimming with fruit, vegetables, meat, and seafood. Not only is it the cheapest option, it’s also the freshest. Most likely that delicious, juicy pineapple was grown at a local farm. A dozen eggs will cost $1.50, a kilogram of beef is $5.10, two pounds of tomatoes is $1.10, and a loaf of bread is the same price. Eating out won’t break the bank either. In local restaurants, you will spend less on a meal than a five-minute taxi ride would cost you back in the U.S. A plate of barbecue meat and rice and a beer will set you back $3.50. A cappuccino will cost around $2.10 and a three-course meal for two can be enjoyed for $15."

		"title": "Manila is Southeast Asia's 3rd most expensive city to live in",
		"content": [
		  "Manila is one of the most expensive cities to live in despite having the lowest average salary for the working class relative to peers in Southeast Asia, according to a research by data aggregator iPrice Group. Based on data culled by iPrice across Southeast Asia’s six largest markets on Numeo database, the Philippines’ capital city has the second-highest rent prices, next only to Singapore.  Given that Singapore is way ahead of its Southeast Asian peers, iPrice said in a statement that “it’s quite surprising that a developing country’s capital city, which is way behind the aforementioned Lion City in terms of economic development, has the second-highest rent prices in the region.”. The price of a one-bedroom apartment in the city center of Manila is 56 percent higher than Kuala Lumpur’s, 47 percent higher than Jakarta’s and 31 percent higher than Ho Chi Minh’s.iPrice said it was a surprise that this was even 9 percent higher than Bangkok’s, a tourism hotspot in Southeast Asia. The cost of living in Singapore is at least 132 percent higher than the other markets, it noted. “Shockingly, however, Bangkok and Manila are neck and neck at the top,” iPrice said.Monthly cost of living in Bangkok is estimated at P51,500 per person. This takes into account every necessity such as rent, food, transportation and utilities. Manila is just 1 percent less expensive than Bangkok with an estimated monthly cost of P50,800 for a single person. Without rent, the total cost of living is estimated at P28,800 a month in Manila. The research noted that Manila’s cost of living stood 33 percent higher than the cost in Kuala Lumpur, 28 percent higher than the cost in Vietnam and 24 percent higher than in Jakarta. “These numbers will leave people scratching their heads because Numeo records Manila to have the lowest estimated average net salary among the other cities,” iPrice said. Citing contributors’ data and aggregated information from authoritative sources, iPrice estimated average salary of Manila residents at only about P18,900 a month. “Given the prices stated above, it leaves us wondering how comfortable Filipinos residing in Manila really are. The average cost of living is 168 percent higher than the average salary, so it comes as no surprise that about 35 percent of Metro Manila’s population is reported to live in unstable, badly constructed shelters in the slums and 11 percent of them reside near railroads or garbage dumps,” iPrice said. iPrice reported that bed space rentals are commonly practiced in Manila. Instead of renting actual rooms or an entire apartment, some locals resort to renting bed spaces and sharing rooms with others, it noted. “This leaves you wondering what other things Manila residents need to bear with given the high costs and low wages. Perhaps leisure expenses or take-outs are kept to a minimum or aren’t enjoyed at all. This, along with Manila having the second-worst traffic in the world, gives you an idea of its residents’ quality of life,” the research said."

		"title": "Quality of life vs cost of living",
		"content": [
		  "In early December 2022, the Social Weather Stations (SWS) released its third quarter survey on whether the quality of life of Filipinos had improved or worsened compared to a year ago. The survey was not commissioned and has been fielded 146 times since April 1983. It was released as a public service, and was the first SWS survey done under the administration of President Marcos. The findings essentially noted that around 30 percent of respondents said the quality of their life got better, 29 percent said it had gotten worse, and 41 percent considered no change at all. In a press release dated March 22, 2023, the Philippine Statistics Authority granted the National Economic and Development Authority (Neda) clearance to conduct a national and regional survey research to estimate a quality of life index for the Philippines. The activity will be done by a third-party organization commissioned by Neda, with results expected in the first week of September this year. The press release gives no indication if this Neda survey was a response to the SWS survey. But it seeks responses that will determine the quality of life of Filipinos, and the importance and satisfaction of each quality-of-life domain. It also seeks to develop a framework for effectively measuring the welfare and well-being of Filipinos to supplement gross domestic product and gross national income data. Compared to the SWS survey, the Neda survey looks to go a bit deeper in figuring out quality of life perceptions among Filipinos by delving into various, though still unspecified or defined, quality of life domains. There’s nothing wrong with a quality-of-life survey. To some extent, it does help in gauging people’s perceptions and sentiments on the quality of their current life. But in terms of figuring out what needs to be done to address quality of life issues, especially where and how to improve it, the SWS does not provide much insight beyond hunger being a key metric, and that the higher the education level of the respondent, the more positive the outlook. To improve quality of life, it’s important to know what specific areas need to be addressed and worked on. The SWS survey doesn’t identify those, and until we see the results of the Neda survey, we don’t know if the latter would be able to do so as well. Furthermore, determining quality of life is highly subjective. Perceptions and expectations of an individual’s quality of life will vary, not only in terms of their individual personality, but also across the various social strata. For example, those at a higher income level will definitely have a different view and expectation from those at mere subsistence level. This is why I find that focusing more on the cost of living, as compared to people’s perception of their quality of life, is a more effective and practical way to tackle the issue. Cost of living and individual or family income will provide a baseline to work from, and will help minimize subjectivity in the evaluation of the challenges and the process of coming up with solutions. What we want out of our life will vary between individuals, but what we all face on a daily basis is the obligation, and to some a challenge, of being able to—at the very least—cover our daily living expenses. It would be preferable for policymakers and lawmakers to dedicate more time and effort to the issue of cost of living and wages, rather than looking at the issue from the context of improving the quality of life. Find and implement ways and means to keep the cost of living down, so there would be some extra amount in our disposable income available for wants, once basic necessities or needs are met. Given this extra, it would be up to people to figure out for themselves how to use it to improve their quality of life."

Its beaches in the 7,107 islands, when combined, make up one of the longest and most stunning shorelines in the world. For most foreigners, the Philippines is a paradise teeming with outdoor adventures and idyllic escapes. There’s also wonderful food, rich culture, and friendly people. The low cost of living in the Philippines and its natural beauty attracts millions of tourists from all over the world. More often than not, tourists who have visited the Philippines fall in love with the islands. Some to the point where they decide to relocate somewhere in the archipelago. It is not only beautiful in the Philippines, but it is also cheap to live in its cities, much cheaper in the provinces. The cost of living in the Philippines is staggeringly lower than most major cities in the world. This is mainly the reason why a lot of westerners choose to retire or relocate here"

		  "Being the center of government, trade and commerce in the country, Metro Manila is expectedly more expensive than other major cities like Cebu and Davao. More so, the cost of living in Manila is significantly higher than in the lesser-developed provinces in the country. This being the case, more and more expats opt to live outside of Manila, buying or renting properties in cities with enough modern amenities but with lower costs of living. Take the cities of Cebu and Davao as examples. According to the Mercer Cost of Living Report for 2020, Metro Manila ranks as the 80th most expensive city for ex-pats to live in the world. The capital city ranked 109th in 2019. Metro Cebu and Metro Davao did not even make it to the list. Manila and Cebu are both industrialized, therefore expensive. Davao City, however, is significantly cheaper than the two. While Davao is a highly-urbanized city with all the amenities required for comfortable living, it is not as expensive as Manila and Cebu."

		  "A huge chunk of the cost of living in the Philippines goes to rent or mortgage of a house. Manila properties are very expensive due to overpopulation and demand. Living in the metro is often not ideal if you are seeking a quiet life. Rent in the city center can cost as high as a thousand dollars if you opt for high-end condos in key areas. On the other hand, rent is half of that in Davao City. Foreigners are not allowed outright ownership of land in the Philippines. However, they are allowed to purchase condominium units provided that the majority of the residents in the building are Filipinos. . While this sounds unfair, the rule serves to protect the local population. Most foreigners, if married to a Filipino, purchase a property under the spouse’s name. The price for an apartment in Metro Manila is also at $1000 or upwards per square meter. A monthly electricity bill usually reflects about P5000 if air conditioning is used in a residential unit, a quarter of the amount is charged if there’s none. Water (tap water) consumption costs between P300-P500 a month. An 11-kilo tank of gas for cooking costs between P750-P800 depending on the global prices of petroleum. If you’re subscribed to cable TV, P500-P1,500 should be added to the monthly budget. Stay-in house help is paid a minimum of P3500-P6000 in Metro Manila and about P2500-P4000 in Davao City."

		  "Another significant portion of your monthly budget goes to food and beverage. While it is tempting to eat out more because of the cheap cost of living in the Philippines, it adds up. A combo meal at a local fast food (McDonald’s, Jollibee, KFC, etc.) costs about $3 while a liter of Coke cost a little more than half a dollar. These prices are true across the country but if you’re going to eat a three-course meal at a gourmet restaurant, prices may significantly differ. Comparing Manila and Davao City, a meal for two in Manila costs $20 while it only costs $15 in Davao City. Furthermore, drinking water takes up a considerable portion of the budget in Manila. In Davao City, tap water is potable so drinking water is basically free. To avoid overspending on food, it is advisable to prepare your own meals. It is also better to buy raw foodstuffs in a public market instead of supermarkets or grocery stores. Prices in supermarkets are double that of prices in a local public market. In grocery stores, the price of your goods will also cover the rent and utilities of the store. Case in point: a kilo of potatoes in a public market costs P90 (about $1.95) and P200 ($4) in a supermarket. It also helps that haggling of prices in public markets is the norm while prices in supermarkets are fixed."

		  "There are many forms of transportation in the Philippines and it is quite easy to get from point A to B especially in large cities. However, because of the large number of motorized transportation, traffic is extremely heavy. In fact, Manila has one of the busiest, most congested, and most frustrating rush hours in the world. Owning a car is pretty expensive in the Philippines; the purchase itself does not require a huge sum but insurance, maintenance, and fuel costs add up. It’s easier and more convenient to use public transportation. In Manila, there are jeepneys, taxis, city buses, MRT and LRT that make going around easier. A jeepney ride costs P10 for the first four kilometers with increments of P2 for each succeeding kilometer. The flag down rate for a metered taxi is at P40 and increases by about P18 per kilometer. Bus fare is about P15 pesos for the first 5 kilometers. These rates are applicable to Metro Manila and may slightly decrease in other cities. Renting a car is also an option especially for those who want more reign on their daily itineraries. A cheap rental is at P2000 ($47) per day or P1500 ($35) per day if rented for a week. If you are headed to other places outside of Manila, catching a flight with a domestic airline is easy, convenient, and affordable. Domestic carriers often hold seat sales to different destinations all over that Philippines and taking advantage of these deals allows you to save as much as 70% off of the original fare. Philippine airports are modern and clean so it’s never hard to travel between the islands. Naval vessels also take passengers and cargo to different parts of the archipelago."

Government-run museums in the Philippines charge little or nothing but donations are accepted. Private museums, however, charge entrance fees which usually cover guided tours and activities. Almost every major mall in the Philippines has cinemas showing both local and international movies. IMAX theaters are available in a number of super malls in Metro Manila, Angeles, Cebu, and Davao. Regular movie tickets for two in Manila costs around P500 ($10) while it costs P300 ($6) in Davao City. Concert tickets vary depending on who is performing; if the artist is from abroad (Lady Gaga, Nikki Minaj, Justin Bieber, etc.), premium tickets can cost as much as P15,000 ($357). There are several theme parks that offer excellent places for bonding with the family at affordable prices. Two that are located close to Manila are Star City and Enchanted Kingdom.

The management of BGC (a private consortium) is also quite diligent in keeping the place in order. Traffic marshalls are very visible and they do their best in trying to keep the traffic flowing most of the time. Traffic rules that put pedestrian first (the only place in the Philippines) are also a valuable feature for residents.

		  "One can get some insightful data from Zipmatch, a real estate website, about the rent level in Fort Bonifacio. For example, it has a tool that allows visitors to see the average rental price of properties in Fort Bonifacio that are currently on their database. These are asking prices. User can sort the data by the type of condo units that they are looking for, such as 1, 2 or 3 bedroom units. For example, you can see the asking rent per square meter for each of the condominiums in Fort Bonifacio in this page. We can see that the asking rent per square meter in BGC is around P900. This is comparable to high end condos in Makati City. The data is good enough for a broadbrush comparison. However, if one is to take the Zipmatch scores such as neighborhood score seriously, we should read carefully on how they are calculated. For example, what they consider as a good neighborhood is based on accessibility to shops and banks, whereas you may have other factors in mind, like walkability, security and so on. Association dues and amenities. see this article. It has been two years since we last updated the association dues, but since the 12% VAT is removed from association dues from the start of 2018, the total cost in this category is likely to be still more or less the same. For a rough estimate, the rent for a 1 bedroom condo unit (40 square meters) is about P35,000 (USD 700) per month."

		  "If you live in BGC and work in other parts of Metro Manila, your best option is to drive or carpool, as public transport is not very convenient nor is it comfortable. The second best option is to use an app assisted car hailing service like Grab. If your office is in Makati, the largest business center in Metro Manila, then each ride can cost P100 to P300 depending on the supply of drivers. This is more expensive than regular taxi, but then the condition of the car is usually better than a taxi’s, and there is a higher degree of security, as the app hailed car can be tracked. The cost of renting a parking space in BGC is around P4,000 to P5000 per month. You can get almost everything you need in BGC, and almost every where is within walking distance. So in theory, your transportation cost can be zero if you work in BGC, or just retire here."

		  "If you cook at home and buy your groceries from supermarkets, the cost in grocery shopping is not too different from that in other parts of Metro Manila. There is no wet market within BGC, but if your house help can go to the nearby wet market in Guadalupe, you can get fresh fish, meat and vegetables at prices that are a little cheaper than the supermarkets’. It is hard to estimate the cost of grocery shopping, as the range of food preferences can be quite wide. Eating out in BGC is a little more expensive than in other parts of Metro Manila. A meal in a simple restaurant like Shaky’s Pizza can cost P300 to P500 per head. There is no old town inside BGC, as BGC was built from an empty lot in the 2000s. This means nearly all places in this nicely maintained place are subject to the same higher cost of land, and tends to attract high-end restaurants. No back or narrow alley with cheap but nice restaurants like they have in Poblacion in Makati City, for example. If you cook, you can live on P500 per day. Eating out decently will cost about P1,000 per meal. A cup of Starbucks currently costs P135 (less than USD 3). In a month, the food bill for one person could be around P18,000 (USD 360) assuming that you eat out only once a week, and have a cup of espresso drinks three times a week."

		"title": "Cost of Living in the Fort Bonifacio Philippines: Utilities",
		"content": [
		  "BGC has its own water utility company. Water rates in BGC is around P135 per cubic meter,┬á which means a bill of around P700 (USD 14) for a two-person household. This water rate is higher than elsewhere in Metro Manila. According to the water company, they pre-filter the water so that it is drinkable from the tap. Nonetheless, many residents are still worried about the safety of the water, and either install their own filter or buy filtered water. Electricity is provided by the main power company in Metro Manila, Meralco, so the rate is the same as in the rest of Metro Manila. However, due to a big explosion that occured in a residential building in BGC a few years ago, many buildings no longer have piped cooking gas supply, and cylinder gas is not allowed in many condominium buildings, so electricity, a more expensive energy source, is the main power supply for cooking. For a two-person household that uses air-conditioning a lot, electricity bill could be over P6,000 (USD 120) per month. The cost of decent internet is around P1,500 per month (USD 30) and if you do not make too many calls, your cell phone bill could be as low as P500 (USD 10) per month."

		  "The most well-known medical facility in Fort Bonifacio is St Luke’s Medical Center. This is probably one of the most expensive medical facility in the Philippines. It has a lot of the most advanced medical equipment, and the hospital rooms are spacious and clean. Many top notch doctors have office there. Its fees may still be competitive if you come from developed countries, but a few weeks’ stay in the hospital could cost enough for you to buy a condo unit outside Metro Manila. We will not give an estimate here."
