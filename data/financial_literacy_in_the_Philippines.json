		"content": [
		  "School teachers play a key role in raising the level of financial literacy of Filipino youth, however, they themselves suffer from low pay, low education level, and lack exposure to financial education programs. These are the findings of a study by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) published in June 2023. ‘Financial literacy’ is the ability of a person to make better and informed financial decisions to manage their wealth properly. It is a skill that is often developed at a young age as financially well-informed children tend to grow as a financially responsible adult, and in order for these children to gain proper financial knowledge, the financial literacy level of the teachers themselves are crucial to the process. The Philippines ranks third from last in terms of financial literacy with only 25 percent of its adult population being financially literate among the eight Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries assessed by Standard and Poor’s (S&P) in 2014, which raised voices of concern across the country. Adding to that, formal account penetration among the low-income population has been low in recent year (BSP, 2019; World Bank, 2015). As regulator of the banking industry and the country’s currency, the BSP’s advocacies are financial literacy and also financial inclusion - that more Filipinos will have access to formal financial services. As it is important to first increase the level of financial literacy of the teachers firsthand in order to educate the rest of the population, the Philippines Central Bank specifically looked into the financial literacy level of the teachers in the Philippines through three sets of survey data: the Teacher’s Survey on Financial Literacy conducted in 2022, Metrobank survey data from 2014 (Ravago & Mapa, 2020), and lastly the 2018 CFS Data covering both teaching and non-teaching populations.The three major findings are eye openers. First of all, a teacher’s overall household financial status reflects the financial literacy of the individual teachers themself. Secondly, a teacher’s Financial Literacy Index (FLI) is directly positive to the teacher’s educational attainment. Lastly, there also is a significant positive relationship between a teacher’s financial literacy and the proportion of household members of the teacher who also have a higher level of education. All three results show that the level of the financial literacy of the household of an individual results in an individual who is capable of making wise financial decisions. As the results emphasize that an individual’s level of financial literacy is determined by the people around them, aside from implementing financial education within the curriculum of the Filipino students, teachers and non-teaching personnel will also be provided with opportunities to strengthen their financial health, such as savings, budgeting, investing, and more. It is also observed that majority of the Filipino population - including teachers - have collective ballooning debt. The NATCCO Network’s Aflatoun Program trains teachers how to integrate financial literacy in the school curriculum.  Since 2006, NATCCO has trained 8,418 teachers from 2,098 schools.  So far, 417,000 school kids have savings deposits in 158 co-operatives amounting to Php 440 Million."

		  "Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Eli Remolona, Jr. has announced that 65 percent of Filipino households now have bank accounts.  Account ownership is a basic indicator of financial inclusion and this jump in account penetration, from 29 percent in 2019, is a big stride in the country’s quest for a financial ecosystem that leaves no one behind. Financial literacy is a driver of financial inclusion.  Financially-literate people make informed financial decisions and support life-transforming goals like saving for education or retirement, using loans responsibly and running a business. Knowing the positive impact of financial literacy on economic growth, the Microinsurance MBA Association of the Philippines (MiMAP) held its first online financial literacy program last Oct. 31. Almost 250 participants from 15 microinsurance mutual benefit associations all over the Philippines attended the program called, “Kaalamang Pinansiyal, Ngayon Na!.”"

		  "There is a growing body of literature providing evidence that financial literacy aids people in making better financial decisions that can lead to improved financial outcomes such as higher savings, lower debts, and greater wealth accumulation. It is good that the BSP is prioritizing financial literacy and education programs because data from the 2021 Financial Inclusion Survey (FIS) show that when asked basic financial literacy questions, only two in 10 Filipinos gained perfect scores, while seven in 10 correctly answered at least half of the questions.  The FIS also indicates that only 42 percent of adult Filipinos correctly identified inflation’s effect on purchasing power and only 30 percent understood simple and compound interest. While more Filipinos may be owning financial accounts, less are saving and availing of insurance compared to 2019.  More adults also reported having outstanding loans.  During the Financial Stakeholders’ Education Expo in November 2022, then BSP Governor Felipe Medalla said that only 25 percent of adult Filipinos are knowledgeable on basic financial concepts, according to the World Bank. He also mentioned a Standard and Poor’s global study showing the Philippines at the bottom 30 out of 144 countries surveyed on financial literacy. Considering these data, I think we need to prioritize our citizens’ financial education and financial literacy. Perhaps, other government institutions — especially those in the education sector — could help the BSP in implementing financial literacy programs for ordinary Filipinos of all ages, especially the young."

		"content": [
		  "Prevalent poverty and low financial literacy negatively impact the growth of the insurance industry, said Deputy Insurance Commissioner Ferdinand George Florendo during the Insurance  Truth and Consequence Forum held in December 2022. Hardly surprising, since basic necessities like food would be all-important to people living below the poverty line. Microinsurance MBAs (Mi-MBAs), whose members comprise mostly microfinance clients from low-income communities, play an important role in promoting insurance and financial literacy among vulnerable groups. Insuring 28.82 million lives, they are the leading providers of microinsurance in the country. They could replicate MiMAP’s and BSP’s financial literacy programs for their membership. The modules can be discussed during Center Meetings, which could serve as venues to educate people about the importance of savings, loans, microinsurance and other financial products as means to improve the economic well-being of their families. I have seen first-hand how effective information-sharing among members can be in instilling credit discipline and helping people manage their finances better. inancial literacy programs encourage Mi-MBA members to build savings, invest in children’s education, buy insurance to protect against financial shocks, and even prepare for retirement. Based on data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), of the 7.6 million Filipinos aged 60 and above, only 20 percent are covered by SSS and GSIS. About 80 percent of Filipinos nearing retirement age are financially unprepared for the financial cost of living beyond their employment years. Mi-MBAs could help by encouraging their members to save for the future or register with SSS as self-employed entrepreneurs. Thru their partner MFIs, they could facilitate microfinance loans for SSS contributions, or even develop retirement fund products for their members. Financial literacy is crucial to poverty reduction.  It empowers people to understand how money works and use that knowledge to ensure a financially secure future for themselves and their families.  Bridging the financial literacy gap among Filipinos requires an all-of-government approach and the support of the private sector. We can all do our part to help improve the financial literacy of every Juana and Juan."

		  "Millete believes that being financially literate means knowing how money works. “It’s very important to know how money works and to have a good relationship with it. You have to understand how your finances can work for you and use those skills to effectively make better money decisions and be empowered to meet your needs and reach your goals. At the same time, financial literacy serves as our protection because it can keep us from falling for get-rich-quick scams,” Millete explained. “It can be overwhelming, but it is not a journey we need to go through alone. There are experts we can consult with, and often for free.  We can be given advice and learn about the products that suit our goal. We just have to make sure that we are asking the right people–ones who have the expertise and have our best interests at heart.”. Millete noted that the Filipinos’ interest in financial literacy heightened after the pandemic, as they began asking about insurance and investments and are eager to strengthen their financial portfolio after the pandemic revealed their vulnerabilities. “Hopefully, after learning about how they can protect themselves financially, more Filipinos will find the courage to consult experts, secure the right products, and commit to their financial empowerment.There are many factors that hinder Filipinos from achieving financial literacy.  “Culturally, we don’t have a separate pocket for insurance and investments, and sometimes, it’s hard to think long-term when you need to provide the needs of the present. We also don’t like talking about death, much less preparing for it. But we’re seeing a shift in this mindset. We have seen this work in the communities,” Millete mused.  “In every program we support, we try to integrate a financial literacy component because we believe in its power to change lives. The interest is there, and we hope to nurture this so more may get on the right path in their financial journey.”"

		"content": [
		  "The population of the Philippines demonstrated continued growth over the years, estimated at  117,337,368 by 2023. The country comprised of more than 7,000 islands is geographically divided into 17 administrative regions of which the most populous are situated in the north, i.e. the regions of Calabarzon, the National Capital Region (NCR), and Central Luzon, collectively accounting for about 38.6% of the total population. The nation’s rich heritage includes over 182 ethnolinguistic groups, and the Filipino people’s cultural, genetic makeup, social dynamics, and historical migrations have shaped the current demographic landscape. Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) significantly contribute to the economy through remittances. The most popular professions among Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) are in healthcare, hospitality, and shipping, which are all in high demand abroad. These opportunities are spread worldwide, with notable concentrations in the Middle East, neighboring countries in the Asia-Pacific, and Western countries. In 2023, the Philippines reported a median age of 25.0 years and a total fertility rate (TFR) of 1.9 (2022), indicating below replacement-level fertility. This contrasts sharply with most OECD countries, which typically have a median age exceeding 40 years due to lower fertility rates. The Philippines possesses the youngest working force in Asia, with an average age of 25.4 years, notably lower than Singapore, Thailand, Australia, and the United States, where median ages range from 37.5 to 38.2 years."

		"content": [
		  "The Philippine economy has demonstrated resilience and growth potential despite global economic challenges, becoming the fastest-growing economy in Southeast Asia expanding by 5.6% in 2023, even amidst the Corona crisis. The GDP per capita of the Philippines in 2022 was USD 3,623, an increase of 1.3% from the 2021 GDP per capita of USD 3,576. The country’s economic shift from agriculture to a focus on services and infrastructure build-out, but less so on manufacturing, has been a key driver of this growth. Additionally, remittances from Filipino workers abroad, which account for roughly 10% of the country’s GDP, have further supported economic development. The Philippine economy is expected to expand by 6.2% in 2024, fueled by rising domestic demand, a recovery in services, and sustained remittances from OFWs. The income development of Filipinos shows a mixed trend, with the poverty rate decreasing from 23.3% in 2015 to 21.1% in 2021 but then increasing to 22.4% (approximately 25 million people) in the first semester of 2023.The government is pursuing larger investments in both human and physical capital to boost medium- and long-term development. With continued recovery and reform efforts, the country aims to becoming an upper middle-income country. Despite all the efforts, the poverty situation in the country remains a significant challenge, with 25 million Filipinos living below the poverty line. Financial literacy is often inaccessible to many due to limited education and resources. For those struggling to meet basic needs like food, the idea of saving for future emergencies can seem like a distant luxury. It is important to note that the discussion about financial literacy primarily centers on individuals above the poverty line, constituting the majority of the population. By highlighting these disparities and underscoring the importance of inclusive financial education and support systems, efforts can be directed towards addressing poverty more comprehensively in the Philippines."

		"title": "Overview of Wealth Distrubution in the Philippines: Wealth Distribution and Savings Rate",
		"content": [
		  "Despite the high economic growth and job expansion, the Philippines continues to struggle with deeply rooted inequality. The wealth distribution in the country is highly uneven, with the top 1% of earners capturing 17% of the national income, while the bottom 50% share only 14% of the income. The Philippines’ Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality, stood at 41.6% in 2021, the highest Gini coefficient among ASEAN’s six largest economies, highlighting significant income inequality in the country. This disparity is a social timebomb, with implications for wealth distribution and economic stability. Foreign influences, particularly Spanish, American, and Chinese heritage, have shaped the wealthy class in the Philippines, stemming from over three centuries of Spanish colonial rule, subsequent American colonization, and ongoing interactions with Chinese traders and immigrants. These historical ties are still evident in cultural norms, inheritance practices, and existing power structures. The World Bank has emphasized the need for policies that promote greater equality of opportunity, such as improving access to quality education, healthcare, and housing. The report also highlighted that inequality starts before birth and is perpetuated over the life cycle, impacting employment opportunities and income. The Philippines aims to become a middle-class society free of poverty by 2040, but addressing high levels of inequality is crucial for achieving this goal. The total personal savings in the Philippines averaged PHP 2,777,379.82 million (approx. USD 49.6 billion) from 2001 until 2022, reaching an all-time high of PHP 6,272,231.91 million (approx. USD 112.1 billion) in January 2022, up from PHP 5,274,123.59 million (approx. USD 94.3 billion) in July 2020. According to a survey on consumer expectations in the fourth quarter of 2023, about 44% of households in the Philippines had savings. The Gross Savings Rate in the Philippines was 10.8% in December 2022. This quarterly updated rate with data from March 1981 to December 2022, showing an average rate of 10.8%."

		"content": [
		  "Many Filipinos spend before they save, which can lead to a lack of savings if nothing is left after expenses. While 96% of Filipinos are concerned about health costs, only 16% are prepared for medical expenses in case of critical illness due to lack of insurance or savings for emergency cases. There is also a rising number of senior-dependents who rely on their children for financial support due to a lack of financial education, which poses a cycle of financial burden from generation to generation until corrective measures are implemented. The financial industry’s goal is to educate Filipinos to prioritize savings then manage spending with what’s left. The government has also taken steps to encourage saving by offering lower loan rates to micro and small business enterprises. The debt culture in the Philippines is deeply ingrained, with borrowing money being a common practice, often viewed as a norm rather than an exception. This normalization of debt, known as “utang,” poses a significant obstacle to financial growth for many Filipinos. Instead of prioritizing saving for unforeseen circumstances, borrowing for emergencies is more prevalent. However, a lack of understanding about the implications of compounding interest and the distinction between good and bad loans further exacerbates financial challenges. This culture of indebtedness is reflected in statistics showing that close to 50% of Filipinos have debts or loans, with various forms of indebtedness such as money owed to individuals, Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) services, and credit cards being prevalent. eWallets and digital platforms actively incentivize consumer debt, often at high rates, leading to potential debt traps. Addressing this debt culture requires promoting financial literacy and fostering a shift towards more sustainable financial practices to enhance economic resilience among Filipinos."

		"content": [
		  "Recent global uncertainties and the rising cost of living have led to new financial attitudes and behaviors among Filipinos. Finance influencers (finfluencers) on social media have become popular for their ability to simplify complex financial concepts, which helps to improve financial literacy. The Corona crisis, for example, has particularly sparked interest in insurance products among the Filipino Gen Z population. Over 40% of Filipinos are now seeking digitally enabled insurance and investment products, to which insurance and financial services companies have positively responded to meet this demand. Some have also launched financial literacy programs targeted at different demographics, including female heads of households, to empower them with knowledge on saving, budgeting, and investing. To promote financial inclusion and recognize that the digitalization of payments are mutually reinforcing, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) has outlined a Digital Payments Transformation Roadmap. The goal is to shift 50% of total retail transactions to electronic channels and increase the percentage of Filipino adults with bank accounts to 70% by the end of this year. Key drivers propelling this transformation include QR PH, high-interest digital banks, and reduced or zero cross-bank transaction fees for certain banks. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) launched the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion (NSFI) 2022-2028 to enhance consumer welfare through financial inclusion and resilience. It aims to bring more Filipinos into the formal financial system, addressing disparities and emphasizing meaningful access to services. Despite progress, a significant portion of the population remains unbanked. The NSFI sets targets and indicators, highlighting governance for stakeholder involvement. The strategy reflects a commitment to a more financially included and empowered society, fostering sustainable growth and shared prosperity. The central bank’s governor acknowledges stakeholders’ contributions to advancing the NSFI agenda."

		  "The Philippines is a country with a young median age, experiencing steady population growth and an economic shift towards the service industry. Despite positive strides with lower poverty rate and economic growth, challenges such as income inequality persist in the Philippine economic spectrum. Many questions remain as we analyze the Filipino financial landscape. Why do Filipinos tend to spend more than save, particularly during the corona crisis? Despite a long-standing culture of saving, why does financial literacy progress slowly? Moreover, what prompts the transition to the service industry, widely regarded as a catalyst for growth, and what factors contribute to the persistence of inequality? Unraveling these queries is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics shaping the financial realities of the Filipino population.Targeted actions are essential to accelerate financial development in the country, encompassing policies addressing the wealth gap and improving access to quality education and healthcare. Empowering Filipinos through financial literacy programs and harnessing digital financial services could contribute to a more resilient economy. With collaborative efforts from both the government and financial institutions, a path can be forged towards a more equitable and prosperous financial landscape for all. The outlook for the Philippine economy remains optimistic, with forecasts indicating sustained growth and private consumption supported by remittances from overseas Filipino workers. The real challenge lies in executing strategies and translating them into tangible impact. Studies alone won’t suffice; it’s the hands-on work and activities that can truly reach the 25 million below the poverty line. Meaningful education becomes transformative when coupled with creating pathways out of their current situations, fostering hope and positive change for the future."

		  "Governor of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Benjamin Diokno emphasised the importance of improving Filipinos’ financial literacy, particularly now that digital transactions are on the rise, emphasising not only the benefits to people but also to the economy. Diokno said the central bank and its private-sector partners want to supplement traditional financial literacy programmes with digital skills-building to boost financial resilience. In his speech at the virtual 4th Financial Education Stakeholders Expo held recently, he said a financially resilient citizen can be more productive, and contribute more meaningfully to nation-building, he said. He went on to explain that the pandemic improved Filipinos’ financial behaviour since more individuals are now saving, purchasing health and life insurance, and planning for retirement due to the pandemic. Diokno stated contributions to the Personal Equity and Retirement Account (PERA) increased from 1,388 in 2019 to 2,671 in 2020, citing statistics from several sources. In addition, the number of life insurance accounts in 2019 was 39.1 million, up from 43.5 million the year before. Non-life insurance coverage increased from 9.8 million in 2019 to 30.3 million in 2020. Prior to the pandemic, roughly 48% of Filipinos who participated in the central bank’s financial inclusion survey indicated they had savings, but that number rose to 53% in 2019. Around 18% of respondents stated they save in banks, up from 18% in 2018 to 21% in 2019. According to Diokno, according to a 2015 World Bank (WB) survey on adult financial literacy, Filipinos have the lowest financial literacy in the region, at 25%, compared to 59% in Singapore, 52% in Myanmar, and 36% in Malaysia, among others. He said that only three out of seven financial literacy questions were correctly answered by Filipino respondents and that inflation, interest computation, and simple division were all underperforming. These findings are supported by related central bank studies, which show that five out of ten persons retain their funds at home and five out of ten take out loans from informal money lenders. He also said that “one in every 100 Filipinos has been victimised by investment scammers, amounting to a total loss of over PHP25 billion.” “These experiences tell us that there is still a long way to go. Many Filipinos are still delaying saving, mismanaging credit, bypassing legitimate investment opportunities, or falling victim to investment scams,” he said. Thus, the government and the private sector have intensified their relationship to improve financial education and literacy among schoolchildren and adults in the Philippines. OpenGov Asia reported various cross-border cooperation between the Philippines and Singapore have extended their fintech relationship, strengthening ASEAN regional payments and providing financial inclusion to Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) and micro-small-to-medium-sized businesses (MSMEs). Governor Benjamin Diokno of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and Managing Director Ravi Menon of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) signed the expanded Fintech Innovation Function Cooperation Agreement during the recent World Fintech Festival Philippines (WFF) 2021 – Singapore Fintech Festival (SFF). The integration of the two countries’ QR and real-time payment systems was one of the highlights. The BSP stated that they are currently taking the first step in integrating the Philippine payment system with those of our ASEAN neighbours, beginning with Singapore. Digital Pilipinas Convenor Amor Maclang expressed his support for the enlarged BSP-MAS Cooperation Agreement by emphasising a whole-of-society approach in addressing today’s and tomorrow’s technological demands. “We will continue to be at the service of both the BSP and the MAS since this agreement is a very essential pillar in tech-ing up our country,” said Maclang, who helped launch WFF 2021 with the MAS."

		  "The annual World Economic forum at Davos happened last week. If you recall, our President Bong Bong Marcos attended the 2023 edition; and that was a great success in establishing globally what his assuming the office represented, and introducing him to several of the European heads of state and political leaders, who regularly attend the forum. The friendships and relationships created back then have gone a long way. For example, when the opportunity for our seafarers to work for European shipping lines was imperiled and averted last year. This 2024 edition was themed “Rebuilding Trust,” and one of the pillars for reaching that goal is ensuring we all speak the same “economic” language. Mentioned as an essential here was propping up financial literacy in every nation – so that a greater number of people can appreciate what’s being done to drive them forward economically, and to better protect themselves when needed.So that had me picking up on a video created for the forum. In Denmark, it’s mandatory for teens to learn how to manage their money. At ages 13-15, they take lessons on financial literacy, how to budget and save, how banks and bank loans operate, and how to exercise their rights as consumers. The program has been in place since 2015, and evidently works as the country has a financial literacy rate of 71 percent, one of the highest in the world. And to make it practical, over 20,000 students across 700 schools take part in Danish Money Week annually. This is when financial sector professionals visit classrooms, and highlight the importance of knowing about money. Singapore launched MoneySense in 2003, a national financial education program that covers basic money management, financial planning, and investment knowledge. While New Zealand has a free financial literacy program called Sorted in Schools, available to 13-18 year old, in 80 percent of schools, and in both English and Maori. Globally, only 33 percent of the global population is deemed financially literate. And studies have indicated how lower rates of literacy lead to wealth inequalities, and even correlate to inequalities in life expectancy – which is really logical, as if not financially literate and protected, you won’t have the resources to pay for treatments, have prepared for that eventuality. You want to know how the Philippines fares in financial literacy? During a Financial Stakeholders’ Education Expo in November 2022, it was said that only 25 percent of adult Filipinos are knowledgeable on basic financial concepts – this according to the World Bank. We’re in the bottom 30 out of 144 countries, according to another global study. We need to improve, right?"

		"content": [
		  "In our world today, financial literacy is no longer a luxury; it’s a necessity. For Filipino millennials, navigating the complex landscape of personal finance can be challenging. However, acquiring financial education is the key to unlocking a brighter and more secure financial future. In this column, let us delve into the importance of financial education. Breaking the cycle of financial struggles- Many Filipino millennials come from families where financial struggles are the norm. Without proper financial education, they risk perpetuating the cycle of poverty and financial instability. Learning how to manage money wisely can empower millennials to break free from this cycle and build a more prosperous future for themselves and their families. Making informed life decisions - Financial education extends beyond budgeting and saving. It equips millennials with the knowledge and skills needed to make informed life decisions. Whether it’s buying a home, starting a family, or pursuing higher education, understanding the financial implications of these choices is crucial. Financial literacy ensures that millennials can make choices aligned with their goals and values. Debt management and avoiding traps - As millennials face the challenges of personal loans, credit card debts and other financial obligations, understanding how to manage debt is vital. Without financial education, they may fall into the traps of high interest loans, payday lenders, or excessive credit card debt. Learning to manage and reduce debt responsibly can help secure their financial future. Remember, debt can either be a good thing or a dangerous thing … everyone should thread debt wisely.Building a strong financial foundation - Financial education lays the foundation for financial success. It teaches millennials how to budget effectively, save for emergencies, invest for the future and plan for retirement. With these skills, they can build a strong financial foundation that provides stability and peace of mind.Navigating economic uncertainty - The Philippines, like many countries, faces economic uncertainties and fluctuations. Financial education equips millennials with the tools to adapt to changing economic conditions. They can better weather economic downturns, job market shifts and inflation by making informed financial decisions.Investing and wealth-building - Investing is a powerful tool for building wealth over time, and it’s a concept that many millennials may find intimidating. Financial education breaks down the barriers to entry, teaching them about various investment options, risk management and long-term wealth-building strategies. With this knowledge, millennials can make informed investment decisions to grow their wealth. Achieving financial independence - One of the ultimate goals for many millennials is achieving financial independence. Financial education provides the road map to this destination. It empowers them to set financial goals, create plans to achieve them and track their progress along the way. Financial independence means having the freedom to pursue their dreams and passions without being tethered to financial constraints. Financial education is not an option; it’s an essential tool for Filipino millennials to secure their financial future and achieve their life goals. With the knowledge and skills gained from financial education, they can break the cycle of financial struggles, make informed life decisions, manage debt effectively, build a strong financial foundation, navigate economic uncertainty, invest wisely and ultimately achieve financial independence.

		"title": "Financial Literacy, Attitude, and Behavior of Female and Male College Students: The case of the university of the philippines visayas",
		"content": [
		  "Financial literacy is important in today’s fast-paced environment. Financially literate individuals understand basic finance concepts, prioritize their expenses, have enough savings, and invest in the right portfolio. These lead to financial security and better decision making of individuals and groups, and are vital to economic development. Related to financial literacy are financial attitude and behavior, which can be described as the motivation and the action after knowledge. Youth and women must be given attention in inclusive finance policies. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), young adults exhibit low financial literacy, and that a gender gap exists. In this study, financial management is discussed in the context of assigned social roles and socialization factors. To assess the level of financial literacy, attitude and behavior of University of the Philippines Visayas students (from Iloilo City and Miagao campuses) and to determine if there is a gender gap, 271 respondents were surveyed, with 188 female respondents and 83 male respondents. Results show that males score higher than females in financial literacy, and the difference is statistically significant. For financial attitude, there is no significant difference in key areas, but female college students have become more aware of the importance of financial literacy during the pandemic. For financial behavior, while there is no significant difference between females and males, females perform better financial planning, and males tend to save regularly. The results of this study have implications on the crafting of gender-responsive financial literacy courses, and on a larger scale, on national financial inclusion policies."

		"title": "Poor Financial Literacy hampers Philippine growth",
		"content": [
		  "Despite the country’s recent economic gains, Sen. Sonny Angara lamented the poor ranking of the Philippines in a recent financial literacy index, which he said may hamper the government’s efforts to pursue inclusive growth. In the 2015 MasterCard Financial Literacy Index, the Philippines ranked second-worst among ASEAN countries, ahead only of Indonesia. “Glowing reviews and optimistic projections have been heaped on the Philippine economy, particularly its financial system. Opportunities abound on account of these developments but many Filipinos do not even have a basic grasp of economic and financial concepts,” Angara said. ADB study: Philippines has no financial literacy program - A study by the Asian Development Bank (ADB)revealed that the Philippines does not have a national strategy for financial education and literacy. “Such illiteracy hides recent economic gains from the minds of many people as it hinders them from participating meaningfully in the country’s notable ascent and economic growth,” Angara said. Angara has filed a bill that seeks to declare the second week of November as Economic and Financial Literacy Week in a bid to develop national consciousness on economic and financial literacy. Under Senate Bill 2779, the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) will serve as the lead agency and will be tasked to plan, initiate, execute and encourage knowledge-expanding activities on economic and financial literacy, which may be adopted by local government units, government-owned and controlled corporations and educational institutions. NEDA will lead the participation and cooperation of relevant government agencies and instrumentalities such as the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, Department of Finance, Department of Education (DepEd), Commission on Higher Education (CHED), National Youth Commission (NYC) and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG). All public and private elementary and secondary schools under the DepEd, all state and private colleges and universities under CHED, the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) and the NYC will be mandated to conduct consciousness-raising and knowledge-expanding activities. These include setting up literature corners, organizing fora and trainings, and conducting basic economic and financial management classes to improve the economic and financial literacy of students and the youth. “We must recognize the growth potential of our country through financially literate citizens who can make sound financial decisions, mobilize savings, and contribute ideas on improving economic and financial policies and programs,” Angara said. Angara is one of the authors of Republic Act 10679, which aims to promote entrepreneurship and financial education among Filipino youth. Financial education an integral part of learning:The DepEd is encouraged, under the bill, to assess and revise the high school economics curriculum to make it more age-appropriate, and ensure that economic and financial education becomes an integral part of formal learning. The Philippine Information Agency and the Presidential Communications Development and Strategic Planning Office are mandated to allot airtime for programs, and to produce and disseminate printed and online materials for economic and financial literacy awareness enhancement.As for private sector participation, the NEDA, in coordination with the Philippine Economic Society and in partnership with other academic and professional institutions, shall plan, initiate and encourage activities which may be adopted by the private sector and civil society."

		"title": "Financial Literacy in the Philippines Remains Low",
		"content": [
		  "Financial literacy in the Philippines remains low, with only two percent of Filipino adults able to correctly answer questions on the topic, according to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). The BSP cited results from a World Bank study, which asked seven questions related to financial literacy including how to compute for compounding interest, inflation, and diversification of investments. The World Bank study stated earlier also found that financial management habits formed during childhood tended to stay with us into adulthood. This means that if a child is raised with the right attitude and mindset about money and savings, they tend to be smarter about finances as they grow. This is evident in their choices as consumers, and how they plan for retirement. In 2014, another World Bank study also found that 20 million Filipinos save money, but not all of them had bank accounts. The following year, an Asian Development Bank (ADB) study said that the country did not have a national strategy for financial education. So why aren’t they doing anything with their money? Why don’t Filipinos invest? It might have something to do with our culture — and again how we form money management habits. Most of us are after instant gratification — work and get paid. Another obvious reason is that many Filipinos only have a low income and therefore have no cash to spare for investment. In 2016, Standard & Poor (S&P) found that only 25 percent of Filipinos are financially literate, with over 75 million having no idea about insurance, inflation, and even the mere idea of savings accounts. Middle class families constitute only about 25 percent of the entire population, and only 0.1 belong to the upper class. Although there have been efforts by both the public and private sector put in place to promote financial literacy, the number of Filipinos who invest — whether in stocks, insurance, or mutual funds — remain between 8 to 10 percent only. t’s important that those of us who can invest, should. Financial literacy is an important part of making the most out of our hard-earned money. Education on investment avenues is vital — some simply may not have heard yet of investment options, while some could know about it but don’t know how to proceed or which steps to take first. The misconception that you need a lot of money to invest should also be broken. “If you want to thrive in today’s economy, you must challenge the status quo and get the financial education necessary to succeed,” are famous words from American businessman and author Robert Kiyosaki."

		"title": "Financial education, technology are crucial in the new normal",
		"content": [
		  "As a developing economy, it is no surprise that the Philippines still has a long way to go when it comes to financial literacy. Just before the government imposed the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) conducted its 2019 Financial Inclusion Survey (FIS), which revealed that Filipino adults could only answer 1 in 3 financial literacy questions correctly. Only a small number of respondents (8%) got all three questions correctly, while almost one-fourth (24%) obtained a zero score. As many families struggle to cope with the economic effects of the pandemic, the need for financial education becomes more crucial than ever. And with this, is the increasing need for digital tools that would make accessing financial services faster, safer and more convenient. In a recent Virtual Media Forum organized by Home Credit, Sheila Paul, Home Credit Philippines’ Chief Marketing Officer, shared how technology plays a key role in serving its customers as well as enabling financial education and literacy. “Digital is the new normal—and financial institutions like Home Credit are fully and quickly embracing digital technologies to reach more people and cater to the public’s ever-changing needs,” said Ms. Paul. The Prague-based company, now with 7 million customers and 2.2 million active monthly users of its mobile app in the Philippines, arrived in the country in 2013 to pioneer in-store financing of mobile phones and other gadgets and commodities, with minimal requirements and loan approval in as fast as one minute. It has since expanded its services from being mainly in malls to now being also heavily present online, with its My Home Credit app offering a slew of features and services. “The pandemic has intensified the demand for online and mobile financial solutions, and we don’t see this slowing down anytime soon,” Ms. Paul said. “This is why on top of allowing our customers to get started on their Home Credit loan applications and check their account status right there in the app, we also developed safer, contactless payment options for our customers such as our QR-enabled credit card and online payment channels, and even our very own Marketplace where customers can shop for different commodities through our mobile platform.” As more Filipinos turn to technology to help speed up their access to loans, there is also an increasing need to safely access their information—especially credit reports, credit scores and other information that can help financial institutions approve loan applications. That is where the Credit Information Corporation (CIC), a public credit registry, comes in, as it is responsible for gathering Filipinos’ comprehensive credit information—be it from loan payment histories or even records of credit facilities— and facilitating its access. Prior to the pandemic, accessing one’s credit information from the CIC was quick and convenient, but also manual and paper-based, requiring consumers to be physically present at CIC premises for the know-your-customer purposes. But now, just like Home Credit, the CIC has undergone a digital transformation of its own. At a fireside chat during the Virtual Media Forum, Atty. Aileen L. Amor-Bautista, the CIC’s OIC, President and CEO, talked about how CIC addressed this issue and enabled secure, remote access to individual credit reports and credit scores in the new normal. “Due to increased borrowing caused by COVID-19, we decided to digitize our services, where individual borrowers get to access their own credit information using their mobile devices through one of our accredited credit bureaus, CIBI with its CIBIApp,” said Atty. Amor-Bautista. “With this app, identity verification is done online to help secure the process, especially since travel is restricted and everyone is advised to do social distancing. With Home Credit and CIC both leveraging on Filipinos’ increased use of mobile phones and the internet especially in the new normal, there remains big gaps in terms of how these same technologies are trusted by consumers especially for financial services. Thus, according to Ms. Paul and Atty. Bautista, education is more crucial than ever in order to build trust—and in this new normal, the education must be done digitally.“With lockdowns and social distancing accelerating the use of digital services, we had to come up with creative, educational, and engaging financial literacy content to reach millions of people,” Ms. Paul added. “Whereas before, our flagship ‘Juan Two Three’ campaign would visit barangays across the country to teach financial literacy, we are now doing it digitally through social media, our website as well as our mobile app, and in the process we are teaching Filipinos how to use these new technologies. Which is why this next phase of our campaign is fittingly called “Digital na si Juan.” Atty. Amor-Bautista also touched on CIC's efforts in ensuring consumer rights protection and gauging creditworthiness amidst the pandemic. “We want Filipinos to know that despite the challenges of this pandemic, their credit information remains not only secure, but also more accessible than ever, which can help them get approved for loans and other financial tools,” she noted. “And with additional support measures such as the Bayanihan To Recover as One Act, we are also making sure that those that have good records who decide to avail of grace periods for loans will continue to have a positive record.” Since 2017, Home Credit and CIC have been conducting joint activities to promote the importance of good credit standing among borrowers, in what both institutions hope to be a long-term partnership in championing financial inclusion and literacy. “From our financial literacy program to our digitized products and services, we hope to continue remaining sustainable in serving more Filipinos,” said Ms. Paul. “Home Credit upholds its commitment to support BSP and CIC in promoting financial inclusion through education and technology, especially in this new normal.”"

		"title": "Impulse Buying and financial literacy among public elementary and high school teachers in the Philippines",
		"content": [
		  "Teachers in the Philippines are stereotypically perceived as heavy financial borrowers due to their limited income.  Debt problem among teachers in the Philippines is seen as a serious concern attributing the debt behavior to a lack of financial literacy.  Literature indicates that financial literacy can reduce the likelihood of impulse buying.  Financial literacy provides a frame of reference for individuals to carefully make good decisions, including wise spending and financial planning.  Impulse buying is a behavioral repertoire signifying lack of planning.  Given their quick access to private financial loan companies, it is worthy to investigate if teachers exhibit lack of financial literacy by engaging in impulse buying.  The first goal of this paper is to understand what individual, familial, and social factors predispose public-school teachers to resort to loans, that is to describe the financial literacy of public-school teachers.  The second was to conduct a needs assessment to better understand what financial-literacy-related interventions can be given to them to improve their financial decision-making, that is to examine relationship between financial literacy and impulse buying.  In this paper, financial literacy is operationalized in terms of two variables, namely, ownership of financial instruments and use of financial records and record keeping. This paper is based on a survey conducted among 310 public elementary and high school teachers in Metro Manila, Philippines.  These schools were purposely chosen as they were identified as partner schools of the CSR program of the private financial institution that requested the conduct of the study.  Results of the study show that savings accounts and debit cards are the more popular financial instruments that many of the teachers possess. Generally, the teachers also manifest a certain level of use of financial records and of record keeping. The results likewise exhibit a negative but weak correlation between impulse buying and financial literacy in terms of use of financial records and record keeping. This means that impulse buying will likely decline if use of financial records and record keeping are constantly practiced or observed. Results of the multiple regression analysis reveal that use of financial records and record keeping predicted impulse buying.  These results necessitate that financial literacy education needs to underscore the importance of the use of financial records and of keeping such records as they can influence individuals to be critical in making decisions concerning purchases.  Practical aspects of financial literacy should also be included such as development of skills in planning and budgeting for sound decision making.  This study indirectly manifests the possibility that debt behavior among public-school teachers may be due to other reasons like the inability to apply higher order thinking skills for financial literacy and financial planning:  analysis of all available financial instruments and their associated risks, review of credit reports to make sense of the available financial instruments, and evaluation of options to align with financial planning and attainment of financial goals."
